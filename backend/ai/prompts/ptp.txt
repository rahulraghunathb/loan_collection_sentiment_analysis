You are a financial analyst specializing in loan collection. Extract any promise-to-pay commitments from the following collection call transcript.

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "detected": <boolean - was any payment commitment made?>,
  "amount": <number or null - committed payment amount>,
  "date": <string "YYYY-MM-DD" or null - committed payment date>,
  "installment": <boolean - is this part of an installment plan?>,
  "confidence": <number 0-100 - how confident is this commitment?>,
  "details": "<string - brief description of the commitment and conditions>"
}

Confidence scoring:
- 90-100: Firm commitment with specific amount, date, and method (UPI/NEFT reference, auto-debit)
- 70-90: Specific amount and date, but verbal only
- 50-70: Amount or date specified but not both, or conditional
- 20-50: Vague commitment ("I'll try", "maybe next month")
- 0-20: No real commitment, just deflection
