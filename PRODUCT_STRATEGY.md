# CollectIQ — Product Strategy

---

## The Problem

Every day, thousands of collection calls happen across banks and NBFCs. What happens on those calls? Nobody really knows.

- QA teams listen to only 2–5% of calls — the rest go unreviewed
- Borrower promises are tracked on spreadsheets — no one remembers what was said last week
- Compliance violations go undetected — until a regulator or ombudsman complaint lands
- Recovery agents prioritize by gut feel — not by who is most likely to pay
- Borrowers change their story across calls — and nobody catches the inconsistency

The result: lower recovery rates, compliance risk, and wasted agent effort.

## What CollectIQ Does

CollectIQ listens to every collection call and turns it into structured, actionable intelligence — automatically.

Think of it as a senior analyst sitting on every call, taking notes, scoring the borrower, flagging risks, and briefing the team — at the scale of thousands of calls per day.

## The Five Intelligence Layers

### 1. Repayment Intent Scoring

Every borrower gets a willingness-to-pay score from 0 to 100 after each call.

A borrower who says "I'll try to pay something next month" scores very differently from one who says "I already transferred the full amount, here's the reference number." Teams stop guessing and start prioritizing based on real signals.

| Borrower | Intent Score | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Priya Sharma | 95/100 | Already paid, provided UTR number |
| Rajesh Kumar | 62/100 | Willing but conditional — claims job loss |
| Amit Patel | 15/100 | Hostile, refuses to pay, cites court case |
| Mohammed Irfan | 25/100 | Evasive, vague promises, avoids calls |

---

### 2. Promise-to-Pay Tracking

Every payment commitment is automatically captured — amount, date, and a confidence score.

No more relying on agent notes that say "customer promised to pay." A firm "I'll pay Rs. 45,000 by Friday via NEFT" is treated very differently from a vague "I'll try maybe next month." Broken promises are flagged automatically.

| Borrower | Promised Amount | Promised Date | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Priya Sharma | Rs. 45,000 | Feb 10 | 95% — Already transferred |
| Rajesh Kumar | Rs. 20,000 | Jan 31 | 70% — Verbal, conditional |
| Sunita Devi | Rs. 5,000/month | Ongoing | 75% — Under hardship plan |
| Mohammed Irfan | Rs. 30,000 | Feb 28 | 25% — Vague, evasive history |

---

### 3. Compliance Monitoring

Every single call is monitored for agent violations — threats, harassment, intimidation, or improper language. Violations are flagged with severity levels (low / medium / high) and exact evidence quotes. This catches issues before they become ombudsman complaints or legal cases.

What gets flagged:

- "Your family will come to know about this. Think about your reputation." — Intimidation (High)
- "We will send people to your house and shop" — Threatening language (High)
- "If there is no payment, the account may be referred for recovery proceedings" — Acceptable escalation warning (not flagged)

---

### 4. Cross-Call Consistency Engine

Compares what a borrower says across multiple calls and flags contradictions. This is the capability no one else has.

Borrowers talk to different agents on different days. They may claim job loss in one call, then mention freelance income in the next. They may promise Rs. 60,000/month, then reduce it to Rs. 15,000 without explanation.

| Call 1 (Jan 10) | Call 3 (Feb 18) | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| "I lost my job, have no income" | "I earned Rs. 35,000 freelancing last week" | Income inconsistency |
| "Job offer, joining Feb 15" | "Joining delayed, background check pending" | Employment status shift |
| "I'll pay Rs. 60,000/month" | "I can only pay Rs. 15,000 this week" | Decreasing commitments |

This turns a single call into a chapter in a broader story. Managers see the full picture, not isolated snapshots.

### 5. Auto-Generated Call Summaries

Every call gets an instant, structured summary — no more listening to recordings or reading agent notes.

Includes:
- What happened — 2–3 sentence synopsis
- Key points — bullet-point highlights
- Next actions — what the team should do next
- Risk flags — warning signs to watch
- Outcome category — committed / partial / refused / dispute / escalation

Before CollectIQ:
> Agent note: "Spoke to customer. Will pay later."

After CollectIQ:
> "Borrower claims job loss from TechServ Solutions 2 months ago. Wife employed but savings limited. Promises Rs. 20,000 by Jan 31 from savings. Requests EMI restructuring upon re-employment. Cooperative tone. Next: Follow up Jan 31, flag for hardship review, verify employment status."

## Summary

CollectIQ is not a call recording tool. It is a decision-making engine for collections teams.

It answers the questions that matter:

- Who should we call first today?
- Is this borrower getting more or less cooperative?
- Are our agents following the rules?
- Is this borrower telling us the truth?
- What happened on the last 5 calls with this person?

Every collection call becomes a data point. Every data point becomes an insight. Every insight becomes a better recovery outcome.
